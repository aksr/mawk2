1.2.1 -> 1.2.2  Jan 1996

1) Improved autoconfig, in particular, fpe tests.  This is far from
   perfect and never will be until C standardizes an interface to ieee754.

2) Removed automatic error message on open failure for getline.

3) Flush all output before system().  Previous behavior was to only
   flush std{out,err}.

4) Explicitly fclose() all output on exit to work around AIX4.1 bug. 

5) Fixed random number generator to work with longs larger than
   32bits.

6) Added a type Int which is int on real machines and long on dos machines.
   Believe that all implicit assumptions that int=32bits are now gone.
